# üçá Devil-Fruit-Catcher

A fun little **arcade-style game built with Pygame** where you race against the clock to catch as many Devil Fruits as possible!  
This is my **first ever Pygame project**, concept inspired by *One Piece* by **Eiichiro Oda**.

###

## What?

**Devil-Fruit-Catcher** is a 60-second challenge game:  
- Fruits fall from the sky.  
- You move the ship (The Thousand Sunny) to **catch them before they hit the ground**.  
- The goal: **score as many points as you can before the timer runs out!**  

###

## How?

- Built using **Python** and the **Pygame** library.  
- The game loop manages:  
  - **Timer countdown (60 seconds)**  
  - Fruit spawning at random positions  
  - Player movement with keyboard controls (`‚Üê`, `‚Üí`) 
  - Collision detection (catching fruits)  
  - Real-time score tracking  
- Assets (img, sounds, txt) are organized into simple folders.  

To play:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeCraftAyan/Devil-Fruit-Catcher.git
cd Devil-Fruit-Catcher
pip install pygame
python main.py
```

###

## Why?

I built this game to:

- Learn the fundamentals of game development with Pygame.
- Create something fun and simple inspired by my love for One Piece.
- Kickstart my journey in building projects that mix creativity + code.
